# [NEW!] Guild - Mastery Chain Link Application
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
```
This application is made for the the [NEW!] Guild Members who are playing a 25 year old Ultima Online video game!
The purpose of this application is to maintain a list of "Mastery Chain Links" owned by the guild and to allow the guild leaders (admins) to allow guild members (users) to select Links for distribution.
Currently, the admins have the ability to enable Link Selection in order that users may select available Links to be distributed. When users have locked in their choices, the admins can then run the Link Assignment Function.
The Link Assignment Function takes all users with active selections, randomizes order, checks for availibility and provides a Delivery List of Link Selections that the admins will deliver to the users. 
This is to ensure that everyone is given an equal chance at getting what they chose in their selections.
All prices and quanities are based on video game items and currencies. No real items or currency is used.
